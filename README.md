# The purpose of this project was to combine our skills in HTML and CSS to make a portfolio page. Using HTML allowed for structural building of webpage content while CSS let us change the look of that content so as to be appealing to a prospective employer.

# The HTML portion contains a header, nav links, two main content sections, and a footer with contact information.

# The CSS section formatted the header and content sections to a unified look, broke down content sections into distinct cards, and formatted the pictures to a uniform height.
